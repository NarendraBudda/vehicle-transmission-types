Lukxtech, a leading vehicle manufacturer, has organized a competition to help select the design of its next-generation remote vehicle-monitoring system. The company manufactures a range of passenger cars based on different engine and transmission configurations.

To win the competition, participants must create a design that caters to all the different models of cars the company makes. As one of the competitors, you need to create a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate the power of your design.
In order to harness the power of an engine and transmit it to the wheels smoothly, a vehicle needs a transmission. The transmission allows the engine to operate at its optimal speed (in rpm) to ensure fuel efficiency and minimal emissions, while allowing the driver to operate the vehicle at the desired speed (in mph).

While modern transmissions can be very complex, they essentially contain a set of gears or equivalent mechanical devices that allow the rotational speed and power of the engine to be transmitted to the wheels
Lukxtech has developed several transmissions to suit the different types of passenger vehicles and the variety of engines that it produces. ?? Affordable entry-level cars are typically fitted with a manual transmission, while the more expensive cars have an automatic transmission. Automated manual transmission (AMT) is a category that carmakers have introduced that is between entry-level and luxury. Furthermore, there are multiple types of automatic transmissions that have been developed by the automobile industry -torque converters, continuously variable transmissions (CVT), and dual-clutch transmissions (DCT).

Lukxtech offers 6-speed CVTS, and 8-speed DCTs.
